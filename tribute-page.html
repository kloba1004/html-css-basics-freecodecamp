<h3>Brief biography</h3>
<p>Andrew Patrick Wood (January 8, 1966 â€“ March 19, 1990) was an American musician best known as the lead singer and lyricist for the alternative rock bands 
Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. </p>
<p>Wood formed Malfunkshun in 1980 with his brother Kevin and Regan Hagar. The band used alter ego personas onstage, with Wood using the name Landrew the Love Child. 
Though the band only had two songs released, "With Yo' Heart (Not Yo' Hands)" and "Stars-n-You", on the Deep Six compilation album, they are often cited as being 
among the "founding fathers" of the Seattle grunge movement. During his time in Malfunkshun, Wood started relying heavily on drugs, entering rehab in 1985.</p>
<p>By 1988, Malfunkshun had disbanded and Wood began jamming with Green River members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament. They soon began writing original material and 
formed Mother Love Bone the same year, adding guitarist Bruce Fairweather (also a former member of Green River) and drummer Greg Gilmore to the lineup. The following 
year, the band signed a deal with PolyGram, issuing a six-song EP, Shine, before going on tour, supporting The Dogs D'Amour. Towards the end of the year, the band 
recorded their debut album, Apple, which was scheduled for release in 1990. </p>
<p>Due to his struggle with drug addiction, Wood checked himself into rehab in 1989, hoping to get clean for the release of Mother Love Bone's debut album. He died 
in Seattle on March 19, 1990 at the age of 24, after being found in a comatose state by his girlfriend following a heroin overdose. </p>

<h3> Author's personal note:</h3>
<p>He was a star that never shone due to tragic overdose. Everyone was shocked when it happened because his music, especially his lyrics, were powerful and engaging, 
yet simple and everyone present saw Mother Love Bone as the next big hit in rock genre. If u ever want to lurk into music u have never heard before, take your time 
to listen to a beautiful song called Man Of Golden Words.</p>
